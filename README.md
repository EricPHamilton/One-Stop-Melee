One-Stop Melee is a Chrome extension that will be available on the Chrome Web Store once the intended features are completed. Once completed, this extension will be a general Melee utility, providing training tools, information look-ups, tournament information, and many other features, all reachable within the fewest clicks possible.

As a general guideline, I will be developing this with the intention of minimizing the number of actions to reach the desired information.

# Completed Features
 - Displays current Twitch.tv livestreams

# Planned Features
 - Daily/Weekly training checklist
   - Training suggestions/templates
 - Twitter Integration
   - Default to track top 100
   - Add others to track
   - Tweet/Retweet/Favorite within extension
 - Information Library
   - Frame data
   - Hitbox gifs
   - Links to suggested tech/character guides
 - Reddit Integration
   - Retrieves posts from /r/ssbm and /r/SmashBrothers
 - Smash.gg links / Tournament Calendar
   - This will merely provide links to tournaments (As to not reduce smash.gg's ad revenue. Their success benefits the scene) 
 - Youtube Integration
   - Provides a list of top/recent videos from the pros, much like the Twitch tab.
